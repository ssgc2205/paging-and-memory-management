### Assumptions made:
    -> If both the main memory and virtual memory are full then the processes in virtual memory cannot run.
    -> Let me explain this with an example let us consider there is 10kb free space in virtual memory and no free space in main memory but we need to run a process of size 7kb which currently is in virtual memory, and there are two processes in LRU queue named "qp" both of size 2kb and 3kb, so these both can be shifted to virtual memory which generates a 5kb free space in main memory but we need 2kb more for the process to run but then I started searching process id in their sorting order in main memory and checked if they can be shifted into virtual memory for the process to run, if there is a process with smallest process id in main memory to go to virtual memory for the current process to swapin then the process will run otherwise a error is generated, in either case the processes which were shifted to virtual memory cannot be called back without another swapin system command for the particular process.
    -> I printed clearly if the system command fails and also when system command implemented.
